# BezierCurves
Bezier Curves Interactive Tool
### Casteljau Alghoritm
The casteljau Alghoritm is used to generate bezier curves through some control points. This algorithm returns a point Q(t) generated by the interpolation of the control points $\left\lbrace P_{1},...,P_{n}\right\rbrace$. It works in the following way:
$$P_{i}^{(1)}(t) = (1-t)P_{i} + (t)P_{i+1},\textrm{ with } i=1,2,...,n-1$$
and for the iterations k with $k>1$ we have
$$P_{i}^{(k)}(t) = (1-t)P_{i}{(k-1)} + (t)P_{i+1}{(k-1)},\textrm{ with } i=1,2,...,n-(k+1)$$
and finally we get
$$Q(t) = P_{1}{(n-1)}(t) = (1-t)P_{1}{(n-2)} + (t)P_{2}{(n-2)}$$
with $t\in [0,1]$. Making the interpolation for each point will give us the curve,more points implies a smoother curve.

### Implementation
lerp: given two points an a value $t\in[0,1]$, gets the interpolation between those two points.

casteljau: Implements the algorithm using the function lerp to get the interpolations between everty pair of points.

updateGraph: updates the curve at the moment of add, erase or move points.

### Use program
Add points: put the mouse in the coordinate where you wish to add the new point and press "a"(with lower case is added at the ending and with capital is added at the beggining).

Erase points: put the mouse over the point and press "d".

Move points: Left click over the point and keep pressed while moving the mouse.
